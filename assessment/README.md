## Data set assessment

### SAINT file summary

Calculate summary statistics for SAINT file (number of interactions, etc.)

Requires:
* SAINT file
* Bait-Gene map
* BFDR cutoff, default 0.01

The bait gene map should be formatted like so:

| bait  | gene  |
|-------|-------|
| bait1 | genea |
| bait2 | geneb |
| ...   | ...   |

1. Run script
```
"$CMSCRIPTS"/assessment/saint-summary.pl -m bait-gene.txt -s saint.txt
```

### Reproducibility

Assess reproducibility of replicates (calculate r-squared for replicates using interactors that have passed the FDR cutoff). Assumes two replicates.

Requires:
* SAINT file
* FDR, default 0.01

1. Run script
```
"$CMSCRIPTS"/assessment/repCheck.R saint.txt 0.01
```

2. Output:
* regression.txt (table with r-squared and adjusted r-squared)
* rsquare_plots.pdf (replicate 1 v replicate 2 plots for all baits)


2. Output:
* summary.txt

### GO term recovery

Takes the significant preys for each bait and gets the enriched terms. Enrichment for each bait will be relative to other preys in the dataset.

Requires:
* SAINT file
* FDR, default 0.01
* Number of top preys to use, default all

1. Run script. If the third argument is a number > 0, only that number of preys for each bait will be used for the enrichment.
```
"$CMSCRIPTS"/assessment/bait-enrichment.R 0.01
```

2. Output:
* bait-enrichment.xlsx or bait-enrichment_topX.xlsx will have five tabs, one for all GO terms, and separate tabs for BP, CC, MF and Corum

### Expected compartments

Create a summary table for each bait, including official symbol, names and expected compartment basedon GO. It will grab the CC compartment with the highest information content, or a list if several equivalent.

Requires
* IC content table (za-information-content.txt)
* Gene annotations (goa_human.gaf without header)
* GO namespace, default C (one of C, F or P)
* UniProt database (uniprot_sprot.dat)
* bait gene map

| bait  | gene  |
|-------|-------|
| bait1 | genea |
| bait2 | geneb |
| ...   | ...   |

1. Run script
```
"$CMSCRIPTS"/assessment/bait-details.pl -i za-information-content.txt -g goa_human_nohead.gaf -m bait-gene.txt -n C -u uniprot_sprot.dat
```

2. Output
* bait-details.txt

### Baits recovered as preys

Produces a plot showing which baits recovered which other baits as preys

Requires: 
* SAINT file
* bait gene map

| bait  | gene  |
|-------|-------|
| bait1 | genea |
| bait2 | geneb |
| ...   | ...   |

1. Run script
```
"$CMSCRIPTS"/assessment/bait-asprey.R bait-gene.txt saint.txt
```

2. Output
* baits-asprey.tsv (open at ProHits-viz) will be clustered and values correspond to AvgSpec â€“ control average
* output reciprocal interactions to R console
